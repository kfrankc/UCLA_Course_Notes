#CS M151B Winter 2016

###Glenn Reinman _reinman@cs.ucla.edu_  
**Lecture**: Mon/Wed 8-9:50 AM in LAKRETZ 110  
**Office Hours**: Mon/Wed 10-11 AM in Boelter 4731G

* Midterm: 40%
* Final: 50%
* HW: 10%

###Topics in this Course
1. Performance
 * ET = IC * CPI * CT
 * execution time = instruction count * cycle per instruction * cycle time
2. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) / ISA
3. Simple Cycle Datapath
 * all MIPS in this class (**Millions of Instruction per second**)
4. Pipeline Datapath
 * hazards
 * advanced pipelining 
5. Caching / Memory
6. Multi-processors / advanced caching

###Application:
ISA: Instruction Set Architecture  
**Micro Architecture**
* Application
* Power
* Heat
* Cost
* Silicon Area
* Physical Design
* Fault Tolerance  

Application Software --> System Software --> Hardware

**8 Great Ideas (_from textbook_)**
1. Moore's Law
2. Abstraction - Simplfy design
3. Make common case fast
4. Performance vs. Paralellism
5. Performance vs. Pipelining
6. Performance vs. Prediction
7. Hierarchy of Memories
8. Dependency via redundancy

# Mathematical Theory of Communication, 1963

## 1. Introductory Note on the General Setting of the Analytical Communication Studies

### 1.1 Communication
* Communication - one mechanism _affects_ another mechanism
### 1.2 Three Levels of Communication Problems
1. Level A - How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted? (technical)
2. Level B - How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning? (semantics)
3. Level C - How effectively does the receiving meaning affect conduct in a desired way? (effectiveness)  

* _Technical_ : accuracy of transference from sender --> receiver 
 * symbols: finite set of discrete symbols
 * signal: continuous function of time
 * 2D patterns: many continuous functions of time  

* _Semantic_ : identity, or satisfactorily close approx. in interp. of meaning by receiver, compared with intended meaning of the sender.  

* _Effectiveness_ : success with which the meaning conveyed to receiver leads to desired conduct on his part. 

### 1.3 Comments
* Theory of Level A is also theory to Levels B and C.
